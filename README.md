A repository of security related skills - like secure code review and pentesting - for Claude and other AI.

These skills have been proven usefull in my day to day activities as pentester and secure code reviewer. They are currentyl being tested and made better in my [baldwin.sh](https://github.com/igbuend/baldwin.sh) code reviewer environment.

## Skills

### SARIF Issue Reporter (SIR)

Many static analyser tools create output in the Static Analysis Results Interchange Format ([SARIF](https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/sarif-v2.1.0.html)) format. This skill reviews all issues and create a detailed report if the SARIF finding is valid.

### Security Patterns

This repository contains several security pattern skills covering authentication, authorization, cryptography, data protection, and system security. Each skill provides the AI with specialized knowledge to help you implement or review security best practices in your apps.

As a pentester and code reviewer I often have to explain issues at a slightly higher level than just the code. These skills are helpfull.

> The security patterns were automatically created by Claude Opus with very little review. Use at your own peril! Expect lots of improvements in the near future.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Why the name **grimbard**?

Grimbard is a character in the medieval fable of [**Reynard the Fox**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reynard_the_Fox). It is a gruesome story, describing the unspeakable atrocities of the trickster.

Oh yes, Grimbard is the badger in the story, a loyal supporter, defender and advisor of the cunning fox. Grimbard represents wisdom, counsel and trustwordy guidance. Perfect for a repository of security patterns and knowledge. Grimbard also gives the advice to the wrong person, for you to decide if this person is you or the AI.
